              Hi Everyone!
              <br><br>As we near the midsemester break, we have two fabulous events in store for you this week, and are excited to announce a few upcoming events for those people in touch with their competitive edge.
              
              
              <br><br>We are still collecting expressions of interest for the upcoming Droid Race Competition, if you're interested please fill out the below EOI by Friday. Remember that this event is targeted towards more experienced students (preferably 2nd year+), and generally requires a commitment of at least 3hrs/week.
              <br><br>DRC info and rules are <a style="color:lightblue;" target="_blank" href="https://qutrobotics.com/droid-racing-challenge/drc-rules/">here</a>. Register your expression of interest (EOI) using the below button. We will reach out to you with more information.
              <br><br><a href="https://forms.gle/33VsR2FEJUn6yquV9" target="_blank" class="btn">Droid Race Challenge EOI</a>


              <br><br>Or for those looking to add a bit more groove to their robots, we are now looking for EOIs for RoboRave Australia. 
              This competition is perfect for any skill level, so click the link below if this sounds like something that's for you.
              <br><br><a href="https://forms.gle/72U1ChPNn6paxoCo9" target="_blank" class="btn">RoboRave EOI</a>

              <br><br>We would also like to announce the launch of our tickets for the Arduino Hackathon. 
              Click on the button below to secure your ticket before they run out!
              <br><br><a href="https://events.humanitix.com/arduino-hackathon-2023" target="_blank" class="btn">Hackathon Tickets</a>


              <br><br>Last week we continued our workshop series as we took you through the basics of PCB design in Altium. Thanks everyone for the great turnout and hopefully you can use what you learned into the future.

              <br><br>This week, come along to our workshop on microcontrollers, which is a fundamental part of pretty much all mechatronics projects, especially ENGG1100. There are some preparation tasks to do, so check down below for more info!

              <br><br>Or if you are more in the mood to kick your feet up, come along this Friday for a bit of fun (and pain) as we build DIY hydraulic arms on Friday in collaboration with PAIN.
              
              <br><br>Also on Friday, we will be running the BBQ stall at the grasy knoll (main food court area). Come and buy a sausage to support the club!

              <br><br>[FYI: You can click on the title of each event below to get to that event's facebook page]

                <div class="event-info">
                    <b>Location:</b> 46-243 - Andrew N. Liveris Building<br>
                    <b>Time:</b> Tuesday 28 March, 6pm <br>

                Are you interested in learning how to control robots with microcontrollers? Do you want to spice up your ENGG1100 project with wireless communication? Then join us for the UQ MARS microcontroller workshop in week 6!
                <br><br>In this workshop, you will learn:
                <br><br> - What a microcontroller is and what types of microcontrollers are out there
                <br> - How to program in the Arduino IDE and upload code to your microcontroller
                <br>- How to use PWM to control a servo motor
                <br>- How to use an ESP32 to communicate wirelessly with another device
                <br><br>This workshop is designed for beginners who have little or no experience with microcontrollers. It is also ideal for first-year engineers who are doing ENGG1100 and want to learn some useful skills for their robot design project. Wireless control can give you an edge over your competitors!
                <br>UQ MARS will provide ESP32s and some Arduino Unos for the workshop, but you are encouraged to bring your own microcontroller if you have one. You will also need a laptop with the Arduino IDE installed.
                <br><br>The workshop will be held on 28th March at 6pm in 46-243 - Andrew N. Liveris Building, Collaborative Room.
                <br><br>The microcontroller workshop is part of a series of workshops that UQ MARS is running this semester that are relevant for ENGG1100 students. So, keep an eye out for future workshops we have planned.
                <br><br>Don‚Äôt miss this opportunity to learn from the experts and have fun with robotics! We hope to see you there!

                    <b>Location:</b> TBD<br>

                Continuing on from the microcontroller workshop, we‚Äôll be jumping right into using sensors. Sensors allow electronic circuits to gather data from the outside world. When combined with a microcontroller, we can use these sensors to react to touch, sound, light, and millions of other stimuli in any way we want.
                <br><br>In this workshop, you‚Äôll learn:
                <br><br>What a sensor is, and what kind of sensors exist out there.
                <br>How digital sensors work (sensors like buttons and Infrared sensors)
                <br>How analog sensors work (sensors like potentiometers and microphones)
                <br><br>We‚Äôll be using the Arduino IDE to program a series of sensors on the Arduino Uno and ESP32 boards. This workshop is great for beginners who are learning their way around microcontrollers, and wish to use sensors to add some automation to their circuits. Additionally, if you are looking to spice up your ENGG1100 project (like adding distance sensors to aim at towers), this workshop is the perfect place to learn how to automate parts of your robot!
                <br><br>UQ MARS will provide some ESP32 and Arduino Uno boards for the workshop, however we highly encourage you to bring your own microcontroller if you own one. You will also need to bring along a laptop with the Arduino IDE installed beforehand.
                <br>The workshop will be held on 4th April at 6pm in 46-243 ‚Äì Andrew N. Liveris Building , Collaborative Room.
                <br><br>This workshop is part of a series of workshops that UQ MARS is running this semester that are relevant for ENGG1100 students. So, keep an eye out for future workshops we have planned.
                <br>Don‚Äôt miss this opportunity to learn from the experts and have fun with robotics! We hope to see you there!

                <br>Hey guys!
                <br><br>My name is Kaiyu Shang. I am a Senior Technician with 13 years of experience as an Aviation Engineer. 
                I have designed the key models of fighter aircrafts in China including : J10, J15, J16, J20, J31,Z9, when I worked 
                in Shenyang Aircraft Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. Following this, I worked as an Engineering Manager for private Research 
                and Development. There, I collected, analysed, and refined data according to client‚Äôs product needs.  Though this, I have 
                had 26 patents approve within various fields of industry within China.

                <br><br>I prefer working on novel design projects as design is both my career and my hobby. 
                The Rapture Recovery charity is something I have become very passionate about which has 
                inspired me to write a raptor science-fiction story to look at the future of people and 
                raptors. I am excited to be studying at UQ and joining UQ MARS. Sharing experiences with 
                each other and creating fun experiences together is how I like to live my life.
