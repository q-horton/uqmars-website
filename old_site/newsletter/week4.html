              Now, onto the newsletter.
              <br><br>
              As a quick recap, last week we held our Intro to CAD Workshop in collaboration with the Mechanical Engineering Student Society (UQMESS). 
              Hopefully everyone who attended was able to pick up the basics of Siemens NX and is feeling more confident with using the software to create 
              simple parts and assemblies. Find out more about Ben, our CAD expert, in this weeks shoutout.
              <br><br>
              We also held our joint Special General Meeting (SGM) with the Biomedical Engineering Society (UQBMES), where we were able to make some important changes to the club's constitution thanks to everyone who was able to attend in person to meet the quorum.
              <br><br>
              This week we'll be holding another double event week.
              First on Tuesday we'll be hosting Dr Jen Jen Chung's talk on Robots in Human Spaces.
              And later in the week on Thursday we'll be teaming up with RoboGals, QUTRC, and EWB to bring our annual Mechatronic Info Night.
              <br><br>
              Looking forward to seeing some of you in person this week, but if not you can always contact us on our Discord or any of our Socials üòÑ

                Abstract:<br><Br>
                The tremendous potential offered by robotic automation has been evidenced by 
                its revolution of large-scale manufacturing, mining, and agriculture.<br><Br>
                Now, with increasing social and economic pressures to transfer this success 
                to service-focused sectors, we're seeing robots moving into our homes, onto 
                our roads and into our airspace. These human-centred spaces heighten the 
                challenges of robotic perception for scene understanding and emphasise the 
                need for robust planning and interaction in unstructured and dynamic environments.<br><Br>
                This talk will focus on how we are tackling these challenges in robotic 
                mobile manipulation scenarios, i.e., tasks where the robot needs to both 
                navigate collision-free as well as physically grasp and manipulate objects within its environment.<br><br>
                We will discuss the importance of problem representation and how this 
                impacts the system's ability to reason and adapt under uncertainty. 
                Finally, we will take an outlook on how these techniques can be further 
                developed to achieve robots that not only operate in our spaces but 
                that are also capable of rich and intuitive collaboration with people.

                Hi everyone! My name is Ben and I'm one of your UQ MARS executives for 2022. 
                I'm a third year mechatronics student and I'm into pretty much anything to do with the robotics space, 
                especially impulse buying way too many microcontroller boards than I will ever need. 
                At the moment, I have a particular interest in cybersecurity and foodtech.
                That's a nice segue to my current working project, which is completely unrelated. 
                At the moment, I am working towards developing a chess engine which will hopefully lead to an automated chess board. 
                And yes, this is to compensate for my terrible chess skills.<br><br>
                
                This is a very long-term project for me, so who knows when it will actually be done. 
                I'm looking forward to spending an inordinate amount of time modelling this project in CAD rather than actually writing the software.
                <br><br>
                <b><u>Fun fact:</u></b> I'm a massive footy nerd - although that's most definitely from the comfort of my couch.
