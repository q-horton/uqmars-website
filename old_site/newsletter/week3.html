              Welcome back, MARS members! <br><br>
              We hope you enjoyed Raggy's fantastic talk last week, and we're grateful for the excellent turnout. 
              This week, we're gearing up for our CAD workshop on Tuesday, and we want to remind everyone 
              that there are some preparation tasks to complete beforehand. 
              Be sure to check out the next section of this newsletter for more details. <br><br>
              We'd also like to give a big shout-out to Francisco, who is this week's featured member. 
              If you're interested in learning how to get started in the UQ MARS Droid Race Challenge (DRC), 
              he's the person to talk to. <br><br>
              And don't forget, our Special General Meeting (SGM) is happening this Thursday! 
              We need your attendance to meet the quorum, and there will be pizza provided at the meeting. 
              Afterward, BMES will be hosting a free LinkedIn workshop, so don't miss out on this opportunity to network and learn.
              <br><br>
              See you there, and read on for more info!

                Join UQMARS & UQMESS for our introduction to CAD workshop in week 3! This workshop is 
                perfect for first year engineering students or any CAD newbies! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª<br><br>

                CAD software is an integral part of the design process in most engineering disciplines, 
                and will prove to be a very useful tool when completing ENGG1100, METR2800 and further courses. 
                In this workshop, we will provide an introduction to CAD and teach the fundamentals of 3D modelling 
                in Siemens NX. You don't need to have any prior knowledge coming into this workshop, as it is aimed 
                towards students who are completely new to the process. By the end you should be familiar with the
                user interface of Siemens NX and be able to create simple parts and assemblies.<br><br>

                This workshop was developed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/messuq/" rel="nofollow">MESS</a>.</p><br>

                There are a few things to prepare before coming to this workshop (see list below). Please also check out the discord page for the
                workshop using the button below.

                Abstract:<br><Br>
                The tremendous potential offered by robotic automation has been evidenced by 
                its revolution of large-scale manufacturing, mining, and agriculture.<br><Br>
                Now, with increasing social and economic pressures to transfer this success 
                to service-focused sectors, we're seeing robots moving into our homes, onto 
                our roads and into our airspace. These human-centred spaces heighten the 
                challenges of robotic perception for scene understanding and emphasise the 
                need for robust planning and interaction in unstructured and dynamic environments.<br><Br>
                This talk will focus on how we are tackling these challenges in robotic 
                mobile manipulation scenarios, i.e., tasks where the robot needs to both 
                navigate collision-free as well as physically grasp and manipulate objects within its environment.<br><br>
                We will discuss the importance of problem representation and how this 
                impacts the system's ability to reason and adapt under uncertainty. 
                Finally, we will take an outlook on how these techniques can be further 
                developed to achieve robots that not only operate in our spaces but 
                that are also capable of rich and intuitive collaboration with people.

                I always have to be doing something. I'm the type of guy who wants to be a part of something bigger than myself. 
                I also enjoy learning new concepts (even if said concept may make the rail way tracks look extra comfy).<br><br>
                My peers and myself are a part of <b>UQ MARS' Droid Race Challenge</b> (DRC) team and we plan to take home gold. 
                Our team comprises of mostly electrical engineers, however each is specialised in a way, shape or form. 
                Myself for example, I try to be as diverse as possible when it comes to my abilities but my 
                strengths mainly lie in chassis design and python programming. Currently my friends and I have 
                created a program that takes input from a Xbox One controller wirelessly and have the onboard 
                computer (running Ubuntu) communicate with the arduino to drive around.

                Hardly autonomous at the moment, but a great start. 
                As of right now the bot is called BEBOOP and is effectively an RC car,
                with a computer on it. Next we are working on the computer vision and camera drivers so that the robot can see.

                If you hadn't already seen this from our previous newsletters, we are currently developing a comprehensive course guide to aid students in the selection of their
                courses.
                The guide will present suggested program structures, enrolment plans, course profiles,
                and offer the chance to inform students of the specific pathways available within Mechatronics and
                adjacent specialisations such as Electrical/Computer Engineering. We will aim to give specialised
                advice from our Exec team and various UQ MARS Alumni regarding study advice, course selection and
                general career advice.
                <br><br>
                Please note that the course guide is currently a work in progess. Check it out using the button below.
