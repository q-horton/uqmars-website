              Members of MARS, hello again!
              <br><br>Can you believe the mid-semester break is already upon us? But before you take a well-deserved break, don't miss out on our two exciting events this week. 
              
              <br><br>On Tuesday we will be jumping right into using sensors with microcontrollers! 
              Sensors allow electronic circuits to gather data from the outside world. 
              When combined with a microcontroller, we can use these sensors to react to touch, sound, light, 
              and millions of other stimuli in any way we want. See the next section for more info about this weeks sensors workshop. 

              <br><br>Also this week, join for an exciting presentation by Universal Field Robots! Learn how they develop fully autonomous robotic vehicles for the rapidly evolving mining industry.
              See the next section for more info about this weeks presentation by Universal Field Robotics. 


              <br><br>Now for a recap on last week's events. Last Tuesday we showed you the basics of programming a Microcontroller, due to some technical issues regarding 
              firmware and Windows, the last part (wireless control of motors) will be put into a YouTube tutorial during the midyear break. 
              We've since resolved those issues, please check out our <a href="https://t.ly/s-R1i">GitHub</a> for more information!
              <br><br>Also last week, on Friday we held a Hydraulic Robotic Arm mini competition with PAIN. Numerous designs came out including hands, a scorpion tail, and an elevator. In the end the elevator won being able to carry ten Redbull cans. This was followed closely by the scorpion-tail design that was able to carry six. We had a great time with PAIN. If you're interested in Physics or want to meet people outside of your major, check them out!

                Continuing on from the microcontroller workshop, we’ll be jumping right into using sensors. Sensors allow electronic circuits to gather data from the outside world. When combined with a microcontroller, we can use these sensors to react to touch, sound, light, and millions of other stimuli in any way we want.
                <br><br>In this workshop, you’ll learn:
                <br><br>What a sensor is, and what kind of sensors exist out there.
                <br>How digital sensors work (sensors like buttons and Infrared sensors)
                <br>How analog sensors work (sensors like potentiometers and microphones)
                <br><br>We’ll be using the Arduino IDE to program a series of sensors on the Arduino Uno and ESP32 boards. This workshop is great for beginners who are learning their way around microcontrollers, and wish to use sensors to add some automation to their circuits. Additionally, if you are looking to spice up your ENGG1100 project (like adding distance sensors to aim at towers), this workshop is the perfect place to learn how to automate parts of your robot!
                <br><br>UQ MARS will provide some ESP32 and Arduino Uno boards for the workshop, however we highly encourage you to bring your own microcontroller if you own one. You will also need to bring along a laptop with the Arduino IDE installed beforehand.
                <br>The workshop will be held on 4th April at 6pm in 46-243 – Andrew N. Liveris Building , Collaborative Room.
                <br><br>This workshop is part of a series of workshops that UQ MARS is running this semester that are relevant for ENGG1100 students. So, keep an eye out for future workshops we have planned.
                <br>Don’t miss this opportunity to learn from the experts and have fun with robotics! We hope to see you there!

                <br>Hey everyone!

                <br><br>I’m Oscar Lloyd and I’m a 1st year mechatronics engineering and physics student. 
                Although I’m only fresh into university life, I’ve had years of experience in the robotics and engineering space. 
                During high school I was a lead team manager for some international robotics teams in competitions such as the FIRST Tech Challenge. 
                Although my days of entering competitions have now passed me, I’ve moved on to helping create these robotics challenges! 
                I’m also a prominent board member of RoboCoast and RoboRAVE competition committees. 
                These non-for-profit organisations bring competitions such as RoboRAVE and STEM education in general to students 
                across Southeast Queensland and greater Australia. I was a competition designer for several of the RoboRAVE challenges, 
                including the Mouse Labyrinth maze. I look forward to seeing some of UQMARS’ members trying to beat it later this year!

                    width="100%">
                </div>
                

                <br><br>Outside of competitions, I’ve also created my own robotics brand with the goal of helping develop A.I. 
                and robotics in schools and communities, as well as for my own passion projects! Much of this began with my operation 
                of two Pepper robots from Softbank Robotics. Through self-learning, I helped develop facial tracking and conversation 
                algorithms for use at the opening of the Maroochydore City Hall, RoboRAVE, and many other events. I’m now looking to use
                my experience with these algorithms to help promote machine learning education in schools.  I’m really looking forward to 
                sharing my experiences with others and helping bring about some amazing UQ RoboRAVE teams!
