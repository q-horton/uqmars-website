              Last week we were delighted to host a talk by Dr Jen Jen Chung. We hope you found it as inpiring and entertaining as we did.
              It it was truly facinating the research that is being done to give robots an understanding of our human environments and what
              these robots can do with this knowledge.
              You can find a recording
              of the talk on our youtube channel here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/UtfjhYphNpI?feature=share">Robots in Human Spaces</a>
              <br><br>
              We also held a Mechatronics Info Night with RoboGals, QUTRC and UQEWB last thursday with a number of great speakers from
              mechatronics related industries on the panel.
              <br><br>
              Unfortunately, there is only one event this week! On Tuesday we are providing a PCB workshop with EBESS, please read more about this workshop 
              in the next section.

                Are you interested in learning how to control robots with microcontrollers? Do you want to spice up your ENGG1100 project with wireless communication? Then join us for the UQ MARS microcontroller workshop in week 6!
                <br><br>In this workshop, you will learn:
                <br><br> - What a microcontroller is and what types of microcontrollers are out there
                <br> - How to program in the Arduino IDE and upload code to your microcontroller
                <br>- How to use PWM to control a servo motor
                <br>- How to use an ESP32 to communicate wirelessly with another device
                <br><br>This workshop is designed for beginners who have little or no experience with microcontrollers. It is also ideal for first-year engineers who are doing ENGG1100 and want to learn some useful skills for their robot design project. Wireless control can give you an edge over your competitors!
                <br>UQ MARS will provide ESP32s and some Arduino Unos for the workshop, but you are encouraged to bring your own microcontroller if you have one. You will also need a laptop with the Arduino IDE installed.
                <br><br>The workshop will be held on 28th March at 6pm in 46-243 - Andrew N. Liveris Building, Collaborative Room.
                <br><br>The microcontroller workshop is part of a series of workshops that UQ MARS is running this semester that are relevant for ENGG1100 students. So, keep an eye out for future workshops we have planned.
                <br><br>Don‚Äôt miss this opportunity to learn from the experts and have fun with robotics! We hope to see you there!

                Continuing on from the microcontroller workshop, we‚Äôll be jumping right into using sensors. Sensors allow electronic circuits to gather data from the outside world. When combined with a microcontroller, we can use these sensors to react to touch, sound, light, and millions of other stimuli in any way we want.
                <br><br>In this workshop, you‚Äôll learn:
                <br><br>What a sensor is, and what kind of sensors exist out there.
                <br>How digital sensors work (sensors like buttons and Infrared sensors)
                <br>How analog sensors work (sensors like potentiometers and microphones)
                <br><br>We‚Äôll be using the Arduino IDE to program a series of sensors on the Arduino Uno and ESP32 boards. This workshop is great for beginners who are learning their way around microcontrollers, and wish to use sensors to add some automation to their circuits. Additionally, if you are looking to spice up your ENGG1100 project (like adding distance sensors to aim at towers), this workshop is the perfect place to learn how to automate parts of your robot!
                <br><br>UQ MARS will provide some ESP32 and Arduino Uno boards for the workshop, however we highly encourage you to bring your own microcontroller if you own one. You will also need to bring along a laptop with the Arduino IDE installed beforehand.
                <br>The workshop will be held on 4th April at 6pm in 46-243 ‚Äì Andrew N. Liveris Building , Collaborative Room.
                <br><br>This workshop is part of a series of workshops that UQ MARS is running this semester that are relevant for ENGG1100 students. So, keep an eye out for future workshops we have planned.
                <br>Don‚Äôt miss this opportunity to learn from the experts and have fun with robotics! We hope to see you there!

                <br>
                Hi everyone, my name is Korben. I‚Äôm a third-year computer science student majoring in Machine Learning. 
                If I had to summarise why I enjoy programming/robotics I would be because I have always enjoyed watching 
                things that I have made exhibit ‚Äúbehaviour‚Äù, in the most general use of the word. 
                This has meant some of the things I have made over the years includes simulating basic evolution, 
                game of life simulations and other systems where an agent may ‚Äúlearn‚Äù behaviour. 
                Hence the interest in Machine Learning and AI. For me robotics is an extension of that as a medium for 
                interacting with the physical world. In a strangely connected way I also love planted aquariums 
                because you can watch things grow, and fish interact with their environment.

                <br><br>I am currently working on a couple projects on & off. 
                The first one is slowly building my own AI/Machine Learning ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù in python. 
                This is purely so I can learn how some very complicated concepts are applied/work by programming it all from scratch. 
                Not meant to be efficient but maybe I will eventually head that way. 
                So far, I have used it to train a model to identify the handwritten numbers from the MNIST dataset with 95% accuracy. 
                The other project is a ‚Äògame engine‚Äô in C++, again from scratch using the OpenGL framework. 
                I haven‚Äôt got very far with that one‚Ä¶it can draw squares‚Ä¶
                

                <br><br>
                <b><u>Fun fact:</u></b> I love rubber duck debugging and strongly suggest everyone buys a rubber duck of their own to talk to. I have 2.
