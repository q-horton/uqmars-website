              UQ MARS was invited by the UQ Women in Engineering Team to the
              2020 Girls in Computing event. Featuring booths from student
              societies, interactive student projects and a gelato cart, the
              event aimed to inspire and excite high school girls about
              computing-related study pathways.

              During the clubs and societies introductions, UQ MARS was
              represented by executive member, Nicole Harding. During 2020,
              Nicole was on the Logistical Committee and next year will be the
              UQ MARS Secretary, one of the club's leading exec roles. Nicole is
              majoring in computer and electrical engineering and joined the
              club to learn more about robotics.

              The night also featured a speech from Anastasia Laczko, the UQ
              MARS Technical Officer, who talked about why she chose to study at
              UQ and how she came to major in Mechatronic Engineering. Anastasia
              also discussed how there are many different pathways to studying
              computing at UQ and that everyone's experience is unique.

              UQ MARS would like to thank the Women in Engineering team for
              inviting us to the event. It was great to chat with so many female
              high school students interested in STEM and robotics and we look
              forward to partaking in more events next year!
