            <p>
              Rebranded from UQ Robotics in 2019, UQ MARS aims to assist its
              students in all their robotic endeavours.  This may be through a
              wide variety of academic, competitive, or career-orientated
              activities, as the society runs workshop events to assist students
              with their learning, has a team interested in competitive robotics
              events and can be a source of networking opportunities with
              industry contacts.
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Student Driven</h3>
            <p>
              We place a large focus on building connections between our
              students. Our club meetings, workshops and games nights are a
              great way to get involved in UQ’s robotics community and introduce
              yourself to some new friends.  The club also has a large focus on
              competitive robotics, having participated in global competitions
              with projects carried through from the drawing board to
              construction to demonstration. Our competitive projects are a
              great way to apply and develop many of the concepts taught in
              classes, and help students build confidence in their abilities as
              developing engineers.  The club is run by our executive team made
              up of undergraduate students, each of whom has a firm passion for
              robotics and technology.
            </p>

            <p></p>
            <h3 class="major">How can I sign up?</h3>
            <p>
              UQ MARS has a membership form you can fill out, or by asking one
              of our executive members to help you. There is also a stall each
              year at Market Day where you can speak with the team and find out
              more about the club. Membership is $2 annually.
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Do I have to be a Mechatronics major to join?</h3>
            <p>
              No! Mechatronics students may make up the majority of our members,
              but UQ MARS is open to any student at UQ with an interest in the
              field and a desire to get involved. As mechatronic systems are a
              composite of many different aspects of engineering, we highly
              encourage interested Mechanical, Electrical, Software and IT
              majors to sign up.
            </p>
            <h3 class="major">How can I participate in a MARS Project?</h3>
            <p>
              Announcements are made to members in the developmental stages of a
              new project. A memo will go out to members and be posted on the UQ
              MARS Facebook page with a description of the project, and a
              request for expressions of interest. Just fill out the form and
              you will be kept in the loop through a mailing list.
