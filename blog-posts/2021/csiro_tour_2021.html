              9 April, 2021 | Queensland Centre for Advanced Technology (QCAT)
            </h3>
            <p>
              UQ MARS had an amazing opportunity to tour CSIRO’s advanced
              facilities aimed at high end robotics research and development.
              Roughly twenty members and three executives gathered outside the
              Queensland Centre for Advanced Technology (QCAT) on the 9th of
              April, 2021, and signed into reception, eager to learn more about
              the institute.

            <p>
              The tour kicked off at the Data61 Robotics Innovation Centre.
              Here, we got to see firsthand the legged robots that the CSIRO
              team are developing, including “Magneto” and a variety of other
              quadrupedal robots. Magneto is a highly flexible navigational
              magnapod, designed to traverse any surface at various degrees of
              incline through a combination of electromagnets and highly
              advanced artificial intelligence. Its applications relate to
              maintenance and inspection, reducing the risk involved in high
              rise structural analysis by removing the need for humans to scale
              building exteriors at great altitudes.

            <p>
              In addition to Magneto, the Data61 team were also working on many
              other exciting projects, ranging from subterranean to marine
              environments. Our tour then took us to the simulated mine CSIRO
              has constructed for their participation in the DARPA Subterranean
              Challenge. The objective of the design created for the competition
              was to navigate in low light conditions, and develop new and
              innovative ways to survey underground environments, from mines and
              tunnel systems to complex urban structures. These robots are a
              subdivision of the many Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AVGs) under
              active research in the company.

            <p>
              Last stop on the tour was the research offices, where we got to
              see the various iterations of the ‘Titan’ Robots involved in
              subterranean mapping competitions. Here, we saw how much a robot
              can change in the span of just a few months of development. It was
              insightful to learn how ideation and design are completed on a
              commercial and federal level.

            <p>
              In conclusion, touring the QCAT campus was an amazing experience,
              and our members found it very inspiring to see the various
              applications of mechatronics and robotics in the research
              industry. We all left excited and enthusiastic to be involved with
              similar projects in the near future. UQ MARS would like to thank
              CSIRO for the opportunity to tour their facilities, and for
              allowing us to take a glimpse into the research and design process
              of their many advanced projects in development.
